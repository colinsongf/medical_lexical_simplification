This pathway includes an iron-dependent extradiol dioxygenase HsaC that cleaves catechols.
Finally we show that the transient immune activation that renders mosquitoes resistant to the human malaria parasite has little to no effect on mosquito fitness as a
measure of survival or fecundity under laboratory conditions.
Proteus mirabilis is an enteric bacterium that forms biofilms on urinary catheters but in laboratory experiments it can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of
spatial patterns.
For instance the chemical environment that symbiotic Escherichia coli encounter in the human gut relates to health of the gastrointestinal tract gut metabolism immune
response and tissue homeostasis.
The microstructure of vertebrate bones and teeth is controlled by polyproline-rich protein matrices (such as amelogenin) that serve as a scaffold to control the
assembly of biological apatites.
During mating DA is used as a feedback mechanism to adjust the activity of multiple sensory-motor neurons and muscles that promote the rhythmic thrusting of the
male copulatory organs against his partner's vulval genitalia.
Dimethylamine undergoes nitrosation under weak acid conditions to give dimethylnitrosamine.
In vitro experiments have established that the invasive growth of malignant tumors is characterized by the dendritic invasive branches composed of chains of tumor
cells emanating from the primary tumor mass.
Humans can remember several visual items for a few seconds and recall them; however performance deteriorates surprisingly quickly with the number of items that
must be stored.
By resurrecting the ancient genes and proteins using high-confidence predictions from many fungal genome sequences available we show that the very first
preduplication enzyme was promiscuous preferring maltose-like substrates but also showing trace activity towards isomaltose-like sugars.
Many cases of drug resistance have been found to be associated with secondary mutations in drug target which lead to the attenuated drug-target interactions.
With the increasing awareness of heterogeneity in breast cancers better prediction of breast cancer prognosis is much needed early on for more personalized
treatment and management.
Herein we show that TcdB from the epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain of C. difficile is more lethal causes more extensive brain hemorrhage and is antigenically variable from
TcdB produced by previously studied strains of this pathogen (TcdB003).
Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a chronic -LRB- long-lasting -RRB- inflammatory condition affecting the salivary gland.
The events are related to post-war poverty and social stresses and to the ready availability of thallium sulphate rodenticides -LRB- rat poisons -RRB- which could be
easily administered to humans in food and drink being virtually tasteless and odourless.
Complement Receptor 3 (CR3) and Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) are pattern recognition receptors expressed on the surface of human macrophages.
Perfumed water was once used but since the nineteenth century this has generally been replaced by sweet hydrangea tea known as "amacha".
Flowers are 4 5 cm in diameter ; calyx with 6 ovate green lobes 5-10 x 5 9 mm ; there are 6 petals widely obovate 15-25 x 15 19 mm yellow or occasionally white
frequently purple at edges and apex ; the staminal ring has 370-510 stamens with filaments 1.5 2 mm long wider at apex yellow with anthers 0.5 mm long ; hood flat
10-20 x 16 20 mm yellow sometimes white with well-developed appendages proximal with anthers distal antherless the pollen of hood turning black with age ;
hypanthium usually puberulous sometimes glabrous ; ovary 4-locular with 12-26 ovules in each locule the ovules inserted on lower part of septum the style 1.5 2 mm
long with annular expansion towards the tip.
However these functional sequences are embedded in a background of DNA that serves no discernible function.
